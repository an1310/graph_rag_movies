    "# Graph RAG on Movie Reviews with Open-Source LLMs\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates how to implement GraphRAG using completely open-source models,\n",
    "optimized for on-premises deployment with NVIDIA A6000 GPUs. We've replaced:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **OpenAI Embeddings** → **BGE-M3** (BAAI's state-of-the-art multilingual embeddings)\n",
    "- **GPT-4** → **Qwen2.5-72B-Instruct** (or Llama-3.3-70B-Instruct)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Open-Source?\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Cost Reduction**: Running on our own hardware costs fractions of pennies vs API calls\n",
    "2. **Data Privacy**: All processing happens on-premises with no external API calls\n",
    "3. **Customization**: Fine-tune models for our specific domain if needed\n",
    "4. **No Rate Limits**: Process as much data as our hardware allows\n",
    "\n",
    "## Hardware Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "This implementation is optimized for 4x NVIDIA A6000 GPUs (192GB total VRAM), but can be\n",
    "adapted for smaller configurations using quantization.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "We're using the Rotten Tomatoes movie reviews dataset, focusing on reviews for the classic\n",
    "comedy \"Blazing Saddles\" to demonstrate that the same GraphRAG principles work seamlessly \n",
    "with open-source models."

    "1. **Use AWQ Quantization** for 2x more throughput with minimal accuracy loss\n",
    "2. **Enable Continuous Batching** in vLLM for better GPU utilization\n",
    "3. **Implement Caching** for frequently accessed entities\n",

    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Fine-tune BGE-M3 on your specific domain for better retrieval\n",
    "- Experiment with different quantization methods (AWQ, GPTQ)\n",
    "- Try DeepSeek-V3 for cutting-edge MoE architecture\n",
    "- Implement production monitoring and A/B testing"
